 lights out . . . the firefly inside
 the wind somewhere else bird tracks in a light snow
 apples cooking in the aroma pictures of my mother canning

 from behind me the shadow of the tickettaker comes down the aisle
 walking to work  pages lap at your feet the quick eye holds up the news to the day
 part of a dog walking by upside down in the roadside puddle
 where the ripple was the fisherman casts his line; another ripple
 quiet strokes of night swimmer the slap of beaver tails . . .

 elderly couple their faces reflected over their sons name
 man in a filthy army jacket tries to scratch on his name
 anzio beach  another wave gathers and breaks
 how many dew drops make up these walls?
 on razor wire squats a crow winter night
 the guards in their towers silk worms in cocoons of light
 blackuniformed winter fly greeting me behind bulletproof glass
 walls of ice deep in forests frozen frogponds
 my silver shackles gossamer threads under these stars
 old guard escorting me coughing like bullfrog cigarette smoke for breath
 prison cat in shadows stalking the shaft of searchlight
 capturing snowflake fireflies with my tongue
 beating time with nightstick, cricket sound while i urinate
 oh, winter moon, what have you done now keeplocked with the mountains?

 suddenly they all look like green bullfrogs!
 decorating my cell again i notice roommate a silverfish on my pillow
 from out of hendersons haiku, my old wifes photograph cells doors automatically locking.

 morning in the french quarter caf au lait & beignets with sparrows
 the river wind blows into the quarter & through his saxophone
 on the riverfront a stranger takes my smile
 the breeze off the mississippi fills my skirt
 behind grillwork down darkness to sun in a hidden courtyard
 cool the alley through the grillwork swirls cat pee smell
 in the morning shops half the doorways fill with shade
 all the mardi gras colors in the masks in the houses
 on the iron lace balconies only flowers sunning
 from the suite dusk fills in the river & all the tiny lights are slow
 
 huge limbs of the live oak their reaching out over the young grass
 in a pecan grove wandering spring shadows cows & blackbirds
 parked on the runway its wings drooped a b52 the winter sun
 the slow day ... in the empty motel corridor a stack of dirty dishes
 sundown in the empty bar the playerpiano keys begin
 the big waitress departs the china teapot shakes
 january sun ... the cotton fields dotted with leftovers
 longest night his forehead burning into my hand
 what passion you had, akiko where can i put even an inch of tonights anguish!
 sucking chocolate squares oh, its a lonely beginning this first night of return to japan
 under this basholess predawn sky how rough the angle of loneliness along this eastern sea
 bent like a puzzle in a childs hand, that back before me in the predawn dark
 is it a walking umbrella? immense the black over that bentagainstthewind angle of loneliness
 a crane skipping before me on this seaside road, its leg a karate lift?
 i hug the boy to me how brave he was to point and say this is a pencil this is a cup
 on my office couch i lean back, back, this nescafes the length of my desire
 in this bare lateafternoon life i make my bare dinner and set out fork and knife
 wanting to embrace even a sleeve tonights lonely angle

 on lookout rock one step to the red hawk
 i a red shaft of light dances on your moist eyelids the searing morning.

 a block from home a pair of rain drops find my haiku notes
 snow geese sarah discovers the letter v
 suddenly twenty years later you taste the same
 through two marriages framed behind beethoven your picture
 talking with him i taste you in the tea you serve
 on your porch only the breeze moves between us
 in the dark car the scent of you and the rainy fields
 juice from the apple runs into my beard as i wait for you
 in the mirror the only picture of us together
 your perfume looking up startled at a stranger
 in the cold fireplace my last letter burning
 still in the taste of afternoon tea, my grandmothers brogue
 a horsedrawn plow sunflowers stand in the traces
 eaves pulling sound from the wind
 walking alone the way oak leaves refuse to fall
 a steady rain the dentists drill turning to snow
 top of the falls your voice somewhere in its sound
 the worm far out on this paved lot more rain
 autumn dusk the crooked road home
 winter morning the closet dark with old shoes
 the family gathered a tear of embalming fluid runs from my brothers eye
 a moth flies through my breath in moonlight
 bitter wind  the hand that cups the flame aglow
 the sound of scissors through quilt stuffing chill autumn moon
 autumn maple a gust of yellow scatters the childs laughter
 autumn sky the wind folds and unfolds a flock of sparrows
 moving into the sun the pony takes with him some mountain shadow
 paddling slowly through the reeds that touch her hair
 the old woman looking into the stars sky all snowy
 against his coat i brush my lips the silence of snowflakes
 away from eyes the stairwell holds us in its arms
 that sonofabitch on the corner has a knife the rain glistens on it
 still childless milkweed
 winters end a bitterness remaining in the dried apricots
 the old garden fence now keeps the goldenrod from the goldenrod
 thin icicles on the telephone wire her distant voice
 hoping the shape of the navel will be good father cuts the cord
 one cricket sound and silence lighting the autumn garden
 hot rock by the stream each of the babys toeprints evaporating
 switching off the light switching off the shadows
 in these dark   waters   drawn up from   my frozen well ...   glittering of spring
 standing still   at dusk   listen ... in far   distances   the song of froglings!
 i dreamed of   battles   and was slain...   oh savage samurai!   insatiable fleas!
 in silent   midnight   our old scarecrow   topples down...   weird hollow echo
 women planting   rice...   ugly every bit   about them...   but their ancient song
 wild geese write   a line   flapflapping   across the sky ...   comical dutch script
 dead my old   fine hopes   and dry my dreaming   but still...   iris, blue each spring
 in this windy   nest   open your hungry   mouth in vain...   issa, stepchild bird
 ballet in the   air ...   twin butterflies   until, twice white   they meet, they mate
 on the death   of his child   dew evaporates   and all our world   is dew ... so dear,   so fresh, so fleeting
 black cloudbank   broken   scatters in the   night ... now see   moonlighted mountains!
 seek on high   bare trails   skyreflecting   violets...   mountaintop jewels
 for a lovely   bowl   let us arrange these   flowers...   since there is no rice
 now that eyes   of hawks   in dusky night   are darkened...   chirping of the quails
 my two plum   trees are   so gracious ...   see, they flower   one now, one later
 one fallen   flower   returning to the   branch? ... oh no!   a white butterfly
 cloudbank   curling low?   ah! the mountain   yoshino ...   cherry cumulus!
 fie! this   fickle world!   three days, neglected   cherrybranch ...   and you are bare
 hanging the   lantern   on that full white   blooming bough...   exquisite your care!
 aprils air   stirs in   willowleaves ...   a butterfly   floats and balances
 in the seasurf   edge   mingling with   bright small shells ..   bushclover petals
 the river   gathering may rains   from cold streamlets   for the sea ...   murmuring mogami
 a gate made all   of twigs   with woven grass   for hinges ...   for a lock ... this snail
 windblown,   rained on ...   bent barleygrass   you make me   narrow path indeed
 arise from sleep,   old cat,   and with great yawns   and stretchings ...   amble out for love
 white cloud of   mist   above white   cherryblossoms ...   dawnshining mountains
 hi! my little   hut   is newlythatched   i see...   blue morningglories
 in the city   fields   contemplating   cherrytrees ...   strangers are like friends
 see, see, see!   oh see!   oh what to say?   ah yoshino ...   mountainallabloom!
 green   shadowdances ...   see our young   bananatree   pattering the screen
 dont touch my   plumtree!   said my friend   and saying so ...   broke the branch for me
 twilight   whippoorwill ...   whistle on,   sweet deepener   of dark loneliness
 reciting   scriptures...   strange the   wondrous blue i find   in morningglories
 many solemn   nights   blond moon, we stand   and marvel...   sleeping our noons away
 mountainrose   petals   falling, falling,   falling now ...   waterfall music
 amorous cat,   alas   you too must yowl   with your love...   or even worse, without!
 the laden wagon   runs   bumbling and creaking   down the road...   three peonies tremble
 ah me! i am one   who spends his little   breakfast   morningglory gazing
 my good father   raged   when i snapped   the peony...   precious memory!
 by that fallen   house   the peartree stands   fullblooming ...   an ancient battlesite
 in the open   shop   paperweights on   picture books...   young springtime breeze
 dim the grey   cow comes   mooing mooing   and mooing   out of the morning mist
 take the round   flat moon   snap this twig   for handle...   what a pretty fan!
 seas are wild   tonight...   stretching over   sado island   silent clouds of stars
 why so scrawny,   cat?   starving for fat fish   or mice ...   or backyard love?
 dewdrop, let me   cleanse   in your brief   sweet waters ...   these dark hands of life
 lightning   flash, crash...   waiting in the   bamboo grove   see three dewdrops fall
 ashes my burnt   hut ...   but wonderful   the cherry   blooming on my hill
 life? butterfly   on a swaying grass   thats all ...   but exquisite!
 glorious the   moon...   therefore our thanks   dark clouds   come to rest our necks
 what a peony...   demanding to be   measured   by my little fan!
 under   cherrytrees   soup, the salad,   fish and all ...   seasoned with petals
 now from   cherrytrees ...   millions of maidens   flying   fierce warlord storm
 moon so bright   for love!   come closer, quilt...   enfold   my passionate cold!
 too curious   flower   watching us pass,   met death...   our hungry donkey
 cloud of   cherrybloom ...   tolling twilight   bell ... temple   ueno? asakura?
 must springtime   fade?   then cry all birds ...   and fishes   cold pale eyes pour tears
 a nursemaid   scarecrow...   frightening the   wind and sun   from playing baby
 on her dead son   in what windy land   wanders now   my little dear   dragonfly hunter?
 a saddening   world   flowers whose sweet   blooms must fall...   as we too, alas...
 describe   plumblossoms?   better than my   verses ... white   wordless butterflies
 lend me water please?   some fresh young   morningglory,   careless ... took my well
 a young sister   pitiful ... on my   outstretched palm   at dusk dies   the little firefly
 you stupid   scarecrow!   under your very   stickfeet   birds are stealing beans!
 afternoon   shower...   walking and talking   in the street   umbrella and raincoat!
 in the farther   field   a scarecrow kept me   company ...   walking as i walked
 pretty   butterflies...   be careful of   pineneedle points   in this gusty wind!
 ah, unrequited   love!   now elevate your chin   and keen   tomcat, to the moon!
 hi! kids   mimicking   cormorants ... you are   more like   real cormorants than   they!
 buzzing the bee   trades   peony for peony   with the butterfly
 such utter   silence!   even the crickets   singing...   muffled by hot rocks
 far across low   mist   intermittently   the lake   lifts a snowwhite sail
 a white swan   swimming ...   parting with her   unmoved breast   cherrypetaled pond
 for a cool   evening   i hired the   old temple porch ...   penny in the dish
 quite a hundred   gourds   sprouting from   the fertile soul...   of a single vine
 swallow in the   dusk...   spare my little   buzzing friends   among the flowers
 old dark sleepy   pool...   quick unexpected   frog   goes plop! watersplash!
 my shadowy path   ive swept all day   and now ... oh no!   camelliashower!
 hard the   beggars bed ...   but sociable   and busy   with insecttalking
 come come! come   out!   from bogs old frogs   command the dark   and look ... the stars!
 over the   mountain   bright the full white   moon now smiles...   on the flowerthief
 starting to   call you   come watch   these butterflies ...   oh! im all alone
 good friend   grasshopper   will you play   the caretaker   for my little grave?
 a lost child   crying   stumbling over   the dark fields ...   catching fireflies
 the snake   departed   but the little eyes   that glared...   dew, shining in the grass
 ah! brave dragonfly   ...   taking for your perch   this swatter   consecrate to death
 i raised my   knife to it   then walked   emptyhanded on ...   proud rose of sharon
 giddy   grasshopper   take care ... do not   leap and crush   these pearls of dewdrop
 darting   dragonfly ...   pull off its shiny   wings and look...   bright red pepperpod
 reply   bright red pepperpod ...   it needs but shiny   wings and look...   darting dragonfly!
 tiny sentences   brushing soft on   my shutters...   bushclover voices
 mirrorpond of   stars ...   suddenly a summer   shower   dimples the water
 sadness at   twilight...   villain! i have   let my hand   cut that peony
 in dim dusk and   scent   a witness   now half hidden...   evenfall orchid
 now be a good   boy   take good care of   our house ...   cricket my child
 wake! the sky   is light!   let us to the road   again...   companion butterfly!
 stillness ...   then the bat   flying among   the willows   black against green sky
 now my   loneliness   following   the fireworks...   look! a falling star!
 stupid hot   melons...   rolling   like fat idiots   out from leafy shade!
 for   morningglories   i can foresee grave   danger...   singlestick practice
 cant it get   away   from the sticky   pinebranches ...   cicada singing?
 silent the old   town...   the scent of flowers   floating...   and evening bell
 vendor of   bright fans   carrying his pack   of breeze...   suffocating heat!
 voices of two   bells   that speak from   twilight temples...   ah! cool dialogue
 deep in dark   forest   a woodcutters   dull axe talking...   and a woodcutter
 camelliapetal   fell in silent dawn ...   spilling   a waterjewel
 in the twilight   rain   these brillianthued   hibiscus ...   a lovely sunset
 friend, that   open mouth   reveals your   whole interior...   silly hollow frog!
 butterfly   asleep   folded soft on   temple bell...   then bronze gong rang!
 good evening breeze!   crooked and   meandering   your homeward journey
 see the morning   breeze   ruffling his so   silky hair...   cool caterpillar
 oh lucky   beggar!...   bright heaven   and cool earth   your summer outfit
 the turnip   farmer rose   and with a fresh   pulled turnip...   pointed to my road
 flower in the   stream   thus too my lovely life   must end, another   flower...   to fall and float away
 i am going out   ...   be good and play   together   my cricket children
 not a voice or   stir ...   darkness lies on   fields and streets   sad the moon has set
 lady butterfly   perfumes her wings   by floating   over the orchid
 if strangers   threaten   turn into fat   green bullfrogs...   pondcooling melons
 yellow evening   sun ...   long shadow   of the scarecrow   reaches to the road
 a camellia   dropped down into   still waters   of a deep dark well
 for the emperor   himself he will not   lift his hat ...   a stiffbacked scarecrow
 in the holy   dusk   nightingales begin   their psalm...   good! the dinnergong!
 live in simple   faith ...   just as this   trusting cherry   flowers, fades, and falls
 night is bright   with stars   ... silly woman,   whimpering   shall i light the lamp?
 black desolate   moor...   i bow before   the buddha   lighted in thunder
 dirty   bathwater   where can i pour   you? ... insects   singing in the grass
 wee bitter   cricket   crying all this   sunny day ...   or is he laughing?
 a short summer   night...   but in this solemn   darkness   one peony bloomed
 long the summer   day ...   patterns on   the ocean sand...   our idle footprints
 angry i strode   home...   but stooping in   my garden   calm old willowtree
 oh do not swat   them ...   unhappy flies   forever   wringing their thin hands
 see ... the   heavy leaf   on the silent   windless day ...   falls of its own will
 rash tomcat   lover...   careless even   of that rice   stuck in your whiskers
 moon so bright   for love!   oh, hear the farmer   by that light...   flailing his lovely rice!
 now the   swinging bridge   is quieted   with creepers...   like our tendrilled life
 dancing in my   silks   money tossed itself   away...   pretty, this paper dress!
 the sea   darkening...   oh voices of the   wild ducks   crying, whirling, white
 white moth,   flutter off   fly back into   my breast now   quickly, my own soul!
 nine times   arising   to see the moon...   whose solemn pace   marks only midnight yet
 watching, i   wonder   what poet could put   down his quill...   a pluperfect moon!
 do your worst,   old frost   you can no longer   wound me ...   last chrysanthemum i
 pebbles shining   clear,   and clear   six silent fishes...   deep autumn water
 a bright autumn   moon...   in the shadow of   each grass   an insect chirping
 you turn and   suddenly   there in purpling   autumn sky ...   white fujiami
 here, where a   thousand   captains swore grand   conquest ... tall   grass their monument
 yellow autumn   moon...   unimpressed   the scarecrow stands   simply looking bored
 white chrysanthemum   ...   before that   perfect flower   scissors hesitate
 cruel autumn   wind   cutting to the   very bones...   of my poor scarecrow
 now in late   autumn   look, on my old   rubbishheap ...   blue morningglory
 a single   cricket   chirps, chirps, chirps,   and is still ... my   candle sinks and dies
 fireworks ended   and spectators   gone away...   ahd how vast and dark!
 two ancient   pinetrees ...   a pair of gnarled   and sturdy hands   with ten green fingers
 i must turn   over...   beware of local   earthquakes   bedfellow cricket!
 oh! i ate them   all   and oh! what a   stomachache...   green stolen apples
 now in sad   autumn   as i take my   darkening path ...   a solitary bird
 at our last   parting   bending between   boat and shore...   that weeping willow
 at furue in   rain   gray water and   gray sand...   picture without lines
 oh sorry tomcat   bigger blacker   knights of love   have knocked you out!
 the old   fisherman   unalterably   intent...   cold evening rain
 while i turned   my head   that traveler   id just passed ...   melted into mist
 visiting the   graves ...   trotting on to show   the way ...   old family dog
 will we meet   again   here at your   flowering grave...   two white butterflies?
 so enviable...   mapleleaves   most glorious   contemplating death
 shocking ...   the red of   lacquered fingernails   against   a white chrysanthemum
 dry cheerful   cricket   chirping, keeps   the autumn gay ...   contemptuous of frost
 deepen, drop,   and die   manyhued   chrysanthemums...   one black earth for all
 before boiled   chestnuts   crosslegged lad   is squatting...   carved wooden buddha
 defeated in the   fray   by bigger battlers   for love...   tomcat seeks a mouse
 asking their road...   seven yellow   bamboo hats   all turned together
 torches! come   and see   the burglar i have   captured...   oh! my eldest son!
 autumn   mosquitoes   buzz me, bite me ...   see, i am   long prepared for death
 nice wild   persimmons...   and notice how   the mother   eats the bitter parts
 gray marsh,   black cloud   flapping away   in autumn rain   last old slow heron
 first white   snow of fall   just enough to bend   the leaves   of faded daffodils
 what a gorgeous   one   that fat sleek huge   old chestnut   i could not get at ...
 none broke the   silence...   nor visitor   nor host ... nor   white chrysanthemum
 if you were   silent   flight of herons   on dark sky ...   oh! autumn snowflakes!
 chilling autumn   rain...   the moon, too bright   for showers,   slips from their fingers
 rainymonth,   dripping   on and on   as i lie abed...   ah, old mans memories!
 november   sunrise...   uncertain, the cold   storks stand ...   bare sticks in water
 from dark windy   hills   voices driving   weary horses ...   shouting of the storm
 slanting lines   of rain...   on the dusty   samisen   a mouse is trotting
 oh former   renter   i know it all, all ...   down to   the very cold you felt
 gray moor,   unmarred   by any path ...   a single branch ...   a bird ... november
 lonely umbrella   passing the house   at twilight...   first snow falling soft
 carven gods   long gone...   dead leaves alone   foregather   on the temple porch
 five or six of   us   remain, huddled   together...   bent old willowtrees
 plume of pampas   grass   trembling   in every wind...   hush, my lonely heart
 teawater,   tired   waiting while we   watched the snow...   froze itself a hat
 cold first   winter rain...   poor monkey,   you too could use   a little woven cape
 winter rain   deepens   lichened letters   on the grave...   and my old sadness
 cold winter   shower ..   see all the people   running   across seta bridge!
 old weary   willows...   i thought how long   the road would be   when you went away
 no oil to read   by ...   i am off to bed   but ah!...   my moonlit pillow
 descending   seaward   faroff mountain   waterfall...   winter nights are still
 all heaven and   earth   flowered white   obliterate...   snow ... unceasing snow
 considerate   dogs ...   stepping off   into the snow   as i walk the path
 but when i   halted   on the windy street   at twilight...   snow struck against me
 call him back!   ah no,   hes blown from sight   already...   fishpeddler in the snow
 crossing it alone   in cold moonlight...   the brittle bridge   echoes my footsteps
 such a little   child   to send to be   a priestling   icy poverty
 windy winter   rain...   my silly big   umbrella   tries walking backward
 buddha on the   hill...   from your holy   nose indeed   hangs an icicle
 this snowy   morning   that black crow   i hate so much...   but hes beautiful!
 look at the   candle!   what a hungry wind   it is...   hunting in the snow!
 if there were   fragrance   these heavy snow   flakes settling...   lilies on the rocks
 ah! i intended   never never   to grow old ...   listen new years bell!
 snowswallowed   valley   only the   winding river...   black fluent brushstroke
 roaring winter   storm   rushing to its   utter end ...   eversounding sea
 eleven brave   knights   canter through the   whirling snow...   not one bends his neck
 going   snowviewing   one by one the   walkers vanish...   whitely falling veils
 yes, come   in! i cried...   but at the windy   snowhung gate   knocking still went on
 see surviving   suns   visit the ancestral   grave ...   bearded, with bent canes
 the orphan   speaks   the yearend party...   i am even envious   of scolded children
 i gave the   greetings   of the bright   new year ... as though   i held a plumbranch
 on jolly new   years day   my last years bills   drop in   to pay their compliments
 deathsong   leaf alone, fluttering   alas, leaf alone,   fluttering ...   floating down the wind
 deathsong   i have known lovers...   cherrybloom ...   the nightingale ...   i will sleep content
 deathsong   feverfelled halfway,   my dreams arose   to march again...   into a hollow land
 deathsong   three loveliest things   moonlight ... cherry   bloom ... now i go   seeking silent snow

 snowstorm youve gained at least a pound snowman!
 tidy kitchen knives all hidden but handy
 bikini top pinned to the park noticeboard end of summer
 side by side in the hammock two unread books
 a red maple leaf that forgot to fall... he fingers his shrapnel scar
 setting off beeps in my smoke detector a daddy longlegs
 to that scythe moon looming over the hospice his tranquil yielding

 his sisters funeral trimming his hair before he goes
 wild geese in flight suddenly the sky so wide
 call of a loon... cove light and shadow ripple in
 summer afternoon settling into its shadow the old labrador
 keeping them for a day the broken pieces of the heirloom bowl
 on the old wall pictures of the past the plaster falling.
 easter sunday neighbours on their knees weeding
 frozen lake a crack, cleaving silence to silence
 into his trousers the old tailor pressing winter light
 quiet suddenly, and crossing the summer lake the rain comes in sheets
 autumn woods a patch of low sunlight just out of reach
 the hurricanes approach in the dark, a hickory nut bounces off our car
 moon at our window the evening still bright enough to sew that button

 passing train water droplets cling to the pussy willows
 remembering dad as the day of his passing approaches

 trying to call it off her face keeps changing in leaflight
 sudden shower the boys dash out without shoes
 first trick or treat the toddler reaches for her mothers face

 stuck in traffic the white billboard bigger than the moon
 the moon has found it for me a mountain path

 first snow how lightly the cat steps
 old priest, his fingers dark with newsprint
 saddle shop the worn seat of her jeans
 autumn evening she lays out his clothes on the bed

 the days shorten seeing less and less of our neighbours
 open market the gypsy baby clutches a grape in her fist
 90 this year the fisherman reels in a fighting trout
 morning sun a patch of frost in the holsteins shadow
 autumn dusk... a weathered hand waves from the train
 first night of snow sifting through his box of old buttons
 checking the obituaries the dead leaves curl under
 our arguement lasts long into the night the windy trees
 snowy morning crows trading places in the tree of heaven
 daydreaming child   cloud in a puddle
 cloudy day giving the prism a twirl
 after love this sweet burst of cherry tomato
 dried tadpole stuck with a pin ticking sleet
 alone again ...the last raspberry sharp on my tongue
 leaves falling the sudden blackness of branches
 midsummer rains the glass on the stoop halffull...
 breast selfexamination a moth batters the screened window
 crosswinds just a black centre on the straw poppy
 autumn butterfly open on the warm boulder
 cold and overcast... dipping my banana slice into sunflower seeds
 fresh bloom of lilac my steps slow
 today the tulips tightly closedmy little boys sullen face
 fly caught in an abandoned web ...summer solstice
 late august pushing through cornstalks midnight racoons
 opening slowly in the warm kitchenthe last frostscarred red rose
 from reed to reed a blackbird follows its song

 after the funeral whiskers still in his razor
 the pagefinders of my fathers daily missal losing their colors
 first buds of spring i change the washers setting to delicate
 among the gravestones with names worn away children play hide n seek
 whalebone from a beach near savoonga winter rain
 all saints morning a path of trodden leaves
 cremated in her favorite kimono small green plums
 spring rain the gravedigger latches the door of his backhoe
 spring rain the cats pink nipples
 loon calls my daughter drawing circles near the fire
 summer evening from across the meadow a call to supper
 shivering on the roof i rub my palms together meteor shower
 ocean breeze a strand of seaweed steadies the kite
 autumn rose even as i sketch the wind more petals fall
 humid july from the stove the smell of old fires
 the wind of autumn a homeless man warms himself hand to mouth
 broken easel the front yard blue with wildflowers
 heat waves the hitchhiker shifts her child to the other hip
 lands end sand in each bite of my apple
 indian summer a fish slips through the gill net
 her 18th birthday for the first time she notices my silences
 spring sunshine the climbing ivy filled with sparrows
 meteor shower a gentle wave wets our sandals
 mountain hike we drink from the beginning of a great river
 spring sun high in his arms the newborn is shown
 snail to know its heart beats too
 lethal injection unable to shut the blind dogs eyes
 end of summer the shape of his feet in his sneakers
 geronimos grave someone has left plastic flowers
 new in town the scent of unknown flowers
 foghorns... we lower a kayak into the sound
 catalog time the garden begins without a seed
 new buterfly... folded wings lean into the wind
 morning overcast a few seeds still dangle from the dandelion
 break up i leave behind her butterfly net
 walking home barefoot, we enter the shadow of the hill
 autumn evening... a page of the old book separates from the spine
 funeral procession... snowflakes blowing into the headlights
 autumn evening my hospital window becomes a mirror
 storm clouds the cry of a shearwater circles the sky
 late into the night we talk of revelations moon through the pines
 the kettle whistles... a blur of garden color on the window
 winter beach a piece of driftwood charred at one end
 riveredge old growth a towering window of stars
 im caught in it too the blossomloosening wind
 over the railroad tracks the slow motion of a snake
 the beetle i righted flies straight into a cobweb
 leaf in my palm its stem extends my lifeline
 about the tree over my small sons grave tell me
 musty smell forgotten...deep into the text
 that venus! leading the cupped moon through every turn of the road
 grabs and opens the fist sowing seeds
 the river coming to it with nothing in my hands
 deep silence the orphaned nestlings this third morning
 summer solstice the long tips of lavender bent by bees
 snowbound coloring inside the lines
 the dumproad pond tadpoles exit a birdhouse
 still sunwarmed... the pulledout scarecrow in my arms
 changing the swallowtail changed by it the spring wind
 letting the branch go a shower of petals falls on the old woman
 toll booth lit for christmas from my hand to hers warm change
 winter seclusion tending all day the small fire
 on the path only one of us touched by a falling leaf
 winter, bedtime static flickers through a white sleeve
 warm river up to our necks in sunset
 beneath the ice the waterfall still falling
 old garden chair sagging with the weight of a single leaf.
 after the stroke... watching only the half of your face that smiles
 city window mountains and pines etched in frost
 autumn deepens an empty snail shell explored by an ant
 early morning sun scattered on the table several grains of salt
 snowflakes no one will miss melt in her hand
 bright leaves blow through her dream house
 scattering his ashes the moon in bits and pieces
 on the river of many names, one cloud floating
 learning too late he didnt like bubinga wood sun strikes the urn
 the war memorial migrating butterflies cover the names
 falling leaves the house comes out of the wood
 leaving you fog on either side of the white heron
 below zero all curled up in the woodpile the skin of a snake
 deep winter the armload of firewood chills the kitchen
 mourning dove calls... my elderly neighbor stills the sound of her hoeing
 august morning a window washer wiping dust from his sunglasses
 snowmelt... she enters the earth on her knees
 an old woolen sweater taken yarn by yarn from the snowbank
 a white horse drinks from the acequia blossoming locust
 sunlight shines red through my fathers thumb on the steering wheel
 two women crying one giving birth the other being born
 approaching the family plot... my furled umbrella turns into a cane.
 chernobyl victim fingers pressing the plastic to his wifes caress
 cloud shadow long enough to close the poppies
 the thick clang of a cowbell the sun deepens
 roses in the smaller room more fragrant
 ninety winters spellbound again
 silent cathedral stainedglass apostles dimming with dusk
 up the path to touch that one oak in last nights dream
 dry leaves the old archer curves his eyebrow
 soft rain the new grave looks old
 morning sneeze the guitar in the corner resonates
 dusk a lone car going the same way as the river
 first days of summer... already the leaves gather beneath the sycamores
 fall leaves the trees the winter sky
 so many ways within the waterfall for water to fall
 after the rain on my vegetable patch a new crop of stones
 frozen in mud by the vacant shanty lottery ticket
 the potters hands gently shape the vase out of himself
 watermelon rind, sitting in its own juice the summer sun
 figure drawing class in the models deepest shadows a stark white string
 ebb tide... a little sea in the shell
 watching rain pouring down...pouring down just watching
 abandoned store large sign reading we never close
 a single strand of spider silk stops her
 endlessly becoming, clouds
 mime lifting fog
 taking time... listening to the grocery clerk
 in the yukon sleeping with one eye shut the summer night
 in soap bubbles again and again his face is broken
 yard sale, sunlight filling mason jars
 leaving home... the smell of smoke from old brick chimneys
 frozen pond white antlers rise through the ice
 june night my mother alone with her cancer
 at dinner biting into roast beef... the butchers thumb nail
 phoning the neighbors their real voices through the open window
 repeating the lecture his eyes following the windowcleaners blade
 tools rusting unused on the work bench a faucet dripping
 full moon  peering into the halfbuilt house
 dusk drawing the ponds depth to the surface
 old woman, wrapping her cats gifts centering the bows
 on the way to work a hot air balloon up in the mist
 this heat; the dogs tail the only breeze
 light up under the gulls wing sunrise
 second husband painting the fence the same green
 such coolness the snail stretches its neck
 the one legged bird that deep bend before taking off
 bird song lost in bird song
 walking in on her dead eyes reflecting snowfall
 in the sea the fireworks rising
 bird feeder untouched...  alone again
 circling each thigh cool of the night river
 small child afraid to throw away his church bulletin
 in utter stillness the incense changes direction
 early spring sun the spinster combs out her hair for nesting birds
 canyon at the very edge riversound
 out of its slipper her bare foot talking under the table
 burial prayers grandson playing hide and seek behind the stones
 between the fireflies the changing shape of darkness
 my fathers hammer warm again in my hand
 under trees and sky the baby studies her hands
 migrating geese once there was so much to say
 sound of her voice carrying eggs across the ice
 moving with the clock towers shadow the flower lady
 heart drawn in dust by the old indian... rain
 whispered dusk a fox picks its way across the ice
 mist lifting the loons cry
 snowmans eye sinking in the spring rain
 autumn afternoon i stand on the shadow of the sparrow
 ten below zero man and boy walk through their breath to read old tombstones
 hot wind the roadrunners beak opens and closes
 blackbirds descend through the floaters in this eye
 the old man closes the shadow in his hand
 spring drizzle rounding the thorn a drop of light
 horizon wild swan drifting through the womans body
 deserted wharf the mine bows to the moon
 a spiders web across the windharp the silence
 under the back steps catfish still flop in the pail the long august night
 horns fold at my shadows touch; brown slug
 early april rain that woman fills every jar, seals them forever
 dead mynah bird... with each passing car its wing flaps
 picking cotton the memory of birdtracks in the snow
 old tea bag; tints the moon slightly
 blackened walnut left unopened winter solstice
 distant woodchopper inside the cabin axbite echoes
 the grey cranes at dusk bending in a line along the crooked fenceposts
 checking for water the woman finds a full moon trapped in the cistern
 old woman, rain in the eye of her needle
 the path shorter now, underfoot the crumbling leaves; the child runs ahead
 cry of the peacock widens the crack in the adobe wall
 fields of snow not only moonlight but the moon
 cold morning sea an old man towels himself in the sunlight
 fields of corn stretching as far as the eye can see within             a lost child
 crossing the bright sky of a nearsighted swimmer, the song of a bird
 and yet perishable is flesh a mountain plum
 what thing cries out deep inside us cooking the turtle?
 lights out ...the firefly inside
 the wind somewhere else bird tracks in a light snow
 apples cooking in the aroma pictures of my mother canning
 dawn another parting with the moon
 back and forth goldfish hot & humid afternoon
 the child points at the moon and says, bird
 one seagull on a shaft of air; dawn
 lean man carving the trees dream.
 morningglory folds into herself into her folds
 from behind me the shadow of the tickettaker comes down the aisle
 walking to work  pages lap at your feet the quick eye holds up the news to the day
 part of a dog walking by upside down in the roadside puddle
 where the ripple was the fisherman casts his line; another ripple
 quiet strokes of night swimmer the slap of beaver tails...
 never expecting the lilies in november nor the small coffin
 the rooms smallness fills with light this morning of snow
 the way of the conch blueing in the sea, and echoing in the wind
 leaving    all the morning glories    closed
 old frog up to his ears in moonlight
 reaching into sky the girl breaks the wish bone of geese
 in a dark bag onions sprouting
 still lake a hawk makes off with its image
 skiers! standing on the wind
 pregnancy shape of the dark side of the crescent moon
 spring sky a seagull enters our selfie
 evening lull a seaside cave exhaling butterflies
 first glimpse of her mastectomy bra winter rose
 silence leaves are falling all by themselves
 the snowspinning wind i dream of only big trees in my prison yard
 after the sunset a white chrysanthemum lights quite alone
 summer night a worm bites through the silence in a fallen acorn
 the shadow of the fish hides in the shadow of a leaf
 shining in a drop of dew all his love
 waiting in the sheaths of ice blades of grass
 places ill never see the backlit wings of migrating geese
 reflection in this oyster shell pearl moon
 spring shower a peacock sips pinkness from the bromliad
 mouth of the river i dream with my cousin boat to boat
 empty jam jar the tadpoles in the ubend
 no clouds a wind in the sheoaks shuffles bits of blue
 loon call     the stillness of the lake
 flashes of lightning across the pasture  sheared sheep
 half light not knowing what today will bring
 winter commute the face of a missing child exits
 over the eggs they laid too soon late falling snow
 suns out a drop on the lily pad changes to green
 the faint melody of a carousel swirling leaves
 winters end fence wire ripples in the wake of a coot
 sacred ground red geraniums where they fell
 winter garden my fathers swing seat still creaking
 dawn grey the scratch of a claw from the sleeping dog
 on the pine a feather stiff with sleet ice moon
 dusk shadows a peacocks cry across the paddocks
 spring birdsong a common cuckoo barges in
 galeforce wind a birds nest becomes what it was
 wind in tamaracks whispering to shadows, shadows
 drawing the geese from the stubble fields the pinktinged sky
 funeral march the crunch crunch crunch of cicada husks
 on the piano photos of the ones who dont visit
 april showers my insideout umbrella drowns a snail
 november dusk a cloud of sparrows rounds the weathered silo
 end of summer the buskers trouser cuffs collect burs
 twilight the late swallow passes the first bat
 stone steps an electric ant takes the handrail
 spring equinox chaise lounge claimed by the swollen river
 turning tide the buoy bobs sideways
 the windfalls he gathered gathering dusk
 november rain the fence around the ruin
 early dusk the elderly sexton wreathed in mist
 storm on the lough streetlamps on seaview lit by sunrise
 laid at the feet of a cat, all the alps
 first snow... filling the emptiness of a curled leaf
 equinox again you speak of leaving
 wild persimmon autumn sun fills the last leaf
 island morning fog the spruce tree and wooden bench webconected
 chill wind the windowsill tomato still warm
 new years snow the tracks of creatures that went by in the night
 mountain sunset an eagle rides the downslope wind
 crossroads the wind takes my hair the other way
 new moon the night watchman goes unseen
 in the chair the cat curls up in my warmth
 where the maple stood a shroud of sunlight
 the things we never did undertow
 winter solstice the barbed wire fence furry with frost
 year end a boat accompanies the river to the sea
 november sunset a galaxy of crows quench the twilight
 receding surf... for every clamshell a sandy wake
 some in, some out of the ebbing tide... the morning oystercatchers
 september wind a better view of compost bins
 stooping on the edge of autumn purple river grass
 country fair cornsilk at the feet of the hucksters
 spring equinox two pines leaning into each other
 end of a stalk the caterpillar climbs a ladder of air
 sun fringed clouds a carrion crow struts from sleeper to sleeper
 horses stand in morning frost one apart stares at the space between
 mountain stillness an empty chrysalis fills with sunlight
 summer morning every other post has its crow
 early frost the fragrance of pine on fire
 cold rain... the fishermen wade deeper into the lake
 winter chill a bull ant climbs the flame tree
 autumn breeze spiders web convex... concave
 the open gate to an empty field country graveyard
 christmas eve swaddled in the buskers case a fiddle
 full flower moon a softshelled crab emerges from itself
 dry season each cowherds song to the well
 birdsong before dawn all the lives ive lived
 moonflower the babys hand closes around air
 freezing rain beading on the blackbirds back
 hot wind a pine cone waddles to the pond
 morning after all my empties full of sun
 milky way the light from one farm stretches down the valley
 new moon changing the photo inside her heart locket
 asylum window a woman scrapes the ice flowers
 so cold those winter stars so close
 something adrift beyond the break gibbous moon
 snowdrop stems a little longer today the warming sun
 this long drought tumbleweeds still tumbling
 stacking stones for a garden wall the weight of their age
 one by one summer raindrops darken the pavement
 summer rain each corner drips to its own tempo
 her texted outrage sent with a well placed tap
 reincarnation lecture i could see her dress in a quilt
 her fingers move as if counting... dusk light
 spring equinox the clack of marbles
 closing day vine tomatoes warm my hands
 answering a question with a question hermit thrush
 new carnival the fortune teller asks the way
 lake trout rising to fire flies among the stars
 circle of leaves the dog finally catches his tail
 a black split down the boulders center ...end of winter
 abandoned trailer lot first snow covers the television set
 an ocean between us ripe mulberries again
 yard sale the empty fishbowl still wet
 cloud light the cows turned out in the harvested field
 evening snow the dark turns lighter
 the youngest so far from home evening star
 bulldozer a yellow caterpillar in its tracks
 receding thunder... one bullfrog then another
 daybreak between mist and pond a loons wake
 autumn rain on the headstone his name darkens
 spider silk broken starlight between pines
 christmas hymns the lady beside him robustly tone deaf
 crack of thunder a vee of geese breaks
 sweet pea vines the skilled hands of my wife
 plum blossoms falling... her fingers lift from the braille
 crescent moon... a horseshoe crab returns to the sea
 moms old farm the gentle curve of the earth
 airing the house i hear the men far away tilling fields
 sweltering heat a black and yellow field spider bundles a grasshopper
 deserted church the yews shadow moves in a pew
 another spring his bottle of after shave still on the shelf
 woods edge stepping inside the sound of the river
 rising sun the sunflowers dark heads
 youngest daughter passing through the willow shoots
 vernal pool the hardy lily cradles a young sun
 birdsong a shovel leans in the snow
 smokers lounge everyone leaves behind a bit of ash
 lifting fog the cormorant on his rock
 sunlit steps a church elder prods the sleeping dog
 midday heat milk cows chew their cuds under the oak trees
 morning moon the soap bar floating just barely there
 day moon the girls next door spin hula hoops
 the surrounding city... slate headstones tilted every which way
 overgrown thicket the intersection of old stone walls
 first spring day the same little nest of faded twigs
 a wave passing waves full moon
 chasing pigeons a little girl releases her fathers hand
 the stone cutters yard polished granite blocks reflect a blossoming peach
 the pallbearers last years acorns crunch underfoot
 mountain rain the rising magpies bloodied bill
 killing frost all day a steady rain of yellow leaves
 divorce day no more staples in our gun
 metal roof the alternating feet of a magpie
 summers end... a float and line dangle from the pine
 sudden shower the steel underbelly of a bridge
 winter sunset their arguments long shadows
 road work three crows study a pavement reflector
 blowing through the holes of the nomads flute autumn wind
 missing face of the snowman pleiades
 backtoback blizzards under one of those mounds a stone buddha
 the colour of the hill pioneer graves
 snowviewing with a stranger the silence between us
 old cat catching birds with her eyes
 early autumn under the old pear tree scent of brandy
 spring cleaning just ahead of the broom a long legged spider
 lavender stalk the weight of one butterfly
 adrift in an old rowboat i follow the moon
 stillness one cicada across the lake
 a pale moth clings to the screen september rain
 old cemetary the broken iron gate never closed
 a solitary walk among stubbled fields the first star
 always a few steps ahead of me grasshopper
 groundhog day six more springs until my social security
 after the rain each leaf has caught a bit of sky
 my closet it keeps so many of my single socks
 falling asleep the rythmn of her breath on my forearm
 sunlit clouds snow in every crack of stone buddha
 morning fog joining our gardens the scent of lavender
 winter stars a faint snore from the bedroom
 raindrops on the leaves of sunflower potan, potan
 pleasantly drunk... fireflies come out of the moon
 study window still missing the green spider that lived in it
 fluttering in the spiders web a butterfly wing
 left out overnight the childs cup filled up with snow
 in the shoebox photos from a different life
 neighbours cat the cicada in its teeth keeps singing
 quiet pier the milky way spills into the sea
 shorter days the wind carries butterflies
 morning fog the muffled sound of the train

 carrying the harvest rhythm of her hips
 a buzzing bumble bee dandelion fluff covers the ripe blackberry
 frigid night a drip in the sink fills the whole house
 cool morning a caterpillar asleep under buddhas ear
 lakeside the irises find their color at dusk
 traveling exhibit a spider in the bonsai tree
 lovers looking up not kissing spring moon

 heart failure folding the sails before nightfall
 november darkness only the tick of the engine cooling
 morning sun a lone crow scatters frost from the pine
 noon a quiet bell reflects the sun
 her new wig the fir trees shed their snow
 enamelled top my sons smile spins around the floor
 sundried grasses quietly, the sparrows whirr as i pass
 almost dawn a heron fluffs the stillness into itself
 bushfire smoke... yachts on the lagoon have no masts
 heavy surf too many moons to count
 carrying sunlight the wings of a dragonfly
 a calf born today lies still as a burlap bag
 collecting... for the dead miners wild violets
 aftershock across the tiles peppercorns roll
 a moment before sunrise ice singing beneath the swans feet
 3 a.m. the obverhead fan clicks clicks clicks
 he leaves in an ambulance the chrysanthmum buds closed tight
 a field in bloom the foals tracks follow the mares
 his fathers death... shadows of raindrops on the window ledge
 fallen leaf the stream carrying another silence
 liquidambar already my toddlers hair darkening
 full moon at motuhoa stingrays cloud the evening tide
 soft mist... a mother cups her babys head
 half light the river scarred by a heron
 summer flood my father wades through the stars
 moonlight the stream flows from shadow to shadow
 day moon hoof prints litter the beach track
 putting on her faded levis the undertaker
 weather change the first child meets her sister
 leaving your home kowhai flowers flick off my windscreen
 twilight a tui mimics a tui
 friends funeral a stranger uses her teapot
 low tide exploring the rock pools a green plastic fish
 bring n buy my wife swaps life stories
 arriving home on census night so many stars
 conversion the sun falls between goalposts
 one toheroa over the limit low winter moon
 beside the high fire risk sign a blaze of montbretias
 sleeping horse angled bones lean into the summer sun
 alcatraz manacles of kelp
 quince blossoms he stops the chemo
 alone now no ruby slippers to take me home
 thousands of feet of darkness above us sleeping swifts
 lullaby meteorites flash beneath heavy lids
 tall grass a hand drowning in snow waves
 midsummer under a leaf hidden from
 alphabet soup i practice cradling love in a stainless spoon
 sauteed fiddleheads dinner begins with grace
 overnight the spiders mathematics
 nightfall no decision required
 nautical chart i touch the depth of my mothers ashes
 slave quarters... the shapes of their shadows in this dust
 shades of blue... the deers remaining eye cradled by bone
 winter dusk my grief released from the crows throat
 formation of geese a log opens to the woodsmans maul
 i seem to be an intermittent shadow... summer clouds
 bitter wind the towhees song three notes short
 falling leaves the clang of horseshoes in the crisp air
 spattering rain the pulse in a sparrows throat
 weathered rail all those carved names through my hand
 mice beneath the floorboards... all her small noises
 daybreak the scent of crushed sweetgrass where deer have lain
 the timbre of a horses heart winter sea
 trying to name the color of the sun yellow peony
 mayflies an unfinished painting on the easel
 opening the door to an unexpected knock the fragrance of plum
 a box turtle slowly unpacks its legs first warm day
 so few feathers left it barely has a name the melting snow

 man in the moon a newsman reports a beheading
 letting go the heart of a sparrow
 cog railway white sky becomes snowflakes
 daffodils a laughing girl with rain in her shoe
 wide open the roses we leave on the motel dresser
 lantern shadows twoteat harmony in the milk pail
 sparse shadow of the plum tree the pull of an old friend
 hot night at the filling station songs of love
 shop window winter light along the violin strings
 childhood home i park in the shade of my cherry stone
 the school bell rings... the wings of a butterfly tremble on the pin
 followed home by a dog i dont know autumn dusk
 blizzard day extra brown sugar on my oatmeal
 in the gutter a crumpled scratch card ragweed in bloom
 gathering dusk fragments of sky between limbs become one
 solar eclipse the rare silence of seagulls
 family secrets a thicket full of ripe raspberries
 plum blossoms i make plans for my ashes
 the piano hammers barely moving... night snow
 dusklight i read her poem differently
 first snow my childs footprints no longer fit inside of mine
 late winter... a king snake stretches across the road
 evening news the soothing weight of the quilt
 snow flurries the square dancers dosido
 sunglints off falling snow the silent no in her smile
 wild berries one training wheel lifts round the curve
 winter light she holds the teacup with both hands
 orion rising she reaches to loosen the pups collar
 spring stars washing my daughters lipstick off the mirror
 still arguing we swim the same river further upstream
 winter rain finding that part of silence which speaks to me
 autumn woods yesterdays walking stick just where i left it
 late for work one empty space petaled in wisteria
 frozen eyes of the just netted fish winter rainbow
 the foul ball lands in an empty seat summers end
 rainy day... a crow on the bare branch sharpens his beak
 hide and seek among the hollyhocks august moon
 winter solitude the lima beans soaking in halfmoonlight
 first light dark limbs of the walnut holding their snow

 treelined stream the falcon rowing through air
 holding the warmth of the afternoon sun dandelion ridge

 spring again birthmarks on the snow gums
 a maple leaf touching other leaves before the ground
 he turns his beach towel to face mecca
 temple gate looking for the priest in winter mist
 prison cell visiting briefly the easter moon
 breastfeeding the slow drip of rain on the nursery roof
 misty rain a footprint on moss fades
 rusted hinge the butterflys wings close, open...
